### Mobile Phone Specifications Analysis
#### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing mobile phone specifications, specifically filtering phones with 8GB of RAM, and visualizing their release year, company, and price. The goal of the analysis is to uncover patterns in pricing trends, particularly how different phone companies set prices despite having similar hardware specifications (RAM size, release year, etc.).

Project Description
Data Collection:
I created a comprehensive data table containing mobile phone specifications, including details such as:

* Brand/Company
* Model Name
* RAM Size
* Release Year
* Price
   Other specifications (e.g., processor, storage, etc.)

Filtering the Data:
I filtered the dataset to focus specifically on mobile phones with 8GB of RAM to ensure consistency in hardware.

Data Visualization:
After filtering the data, I created a visual plot that shows:

Release Year vs. Company

Price distribution across different companies

Findings:
The plot highlights an interesting trend:
Some phone companies consistently charge more for their products, even when the hardware specifications (e.g., RAM size, release year) are similar to those of other brands. This suggests that factors like branding, market positioning, and perceived value may play a significant role in pricing strategies.

Technologies Used
